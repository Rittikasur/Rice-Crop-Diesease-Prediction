Rice crop generally faces many types of diseases. Agriculturist used to solve those problems using domain knowledge and maual analysis depending upon the symptoms. 
The behavior/pattern of symptoms can be analyzed and an accurate disease detection solution will be developed using Deep Learning Model.


Major solution component are stated below:

● A Deep Learning Model for detecting various crop diseases has been developed.
● An API to utilize the AI model is designed and developed.
● The API will accept images of leaf of the crop as input
● The API will execute the trained AI model and detect the crop disease
● The API can be integrated with any existing system

Images used for model training was custom collected and preprocessed:

● Image of rice leafs having 4 diseases - Bacterial Blight, Blast, Tungro, Brownspot is used for model training.
● Approximately 2000 images for disease was used to train the model.

**The trained model, along with API, Training, Testing code is provided in the repository. The data used for training the model cannot be shared due to confidentiality.
